Objective & Steps are described in the code of the module :

  // Objective : Ingesting bike pole stats into our Database
  //
  // Proposed steps :
  // 1. Having all bike pole stats in a nice formatted array of objects at the end of this function
  // 2. Study the existing Schema. Do we have a schema that fits Bike Pole data?
  // 2.a If yes, parse the data into the schema
  // 2.b If no, create a new schema
  // 3. This is a bare-bone module. We should migrate to a proper Connector so we can inject the data into our database
  // 4. What should be the run frequnency of the module?
  //    How often should we ingest the data?
  //     What happen during subsequent runs, when we already have some data in the DB?
